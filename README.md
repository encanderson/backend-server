### Overview

<div style="text-align: justify">

The journey of knowledge is an endless path, we never stop. More than two years ago (August, 2019), I started learn about software development, since then I keep my journey.

In my Master's, Solar Energy Engineering, I have the opportunity to develop software to simulate a photovoltaic energy system. I loved an experience, especially when I first meet the Python language, that blow my mind.

The proposal to my final project was the development in the Python language. My time was divided in learn about solar energy and software development.

How you know, Python is a general-purpose language, we can develop web applications, data processing, machine learning and so on.

I started with web development with Flask to serve the front-end with Jinja template and apis. Recently, I change my first choice to develop apis with the FastAPI, "a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints".

This project is my first contribution in the devs community, I hope don't stop

In my goals, I follow the back-end <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend" target="_blank">back-end</a> roadmap.

In this project we can analyze how the basic structure of an Nginx proxy server, the MongoDB database and an API with a flow to register user, password recovery and login. The system design is strucutured in microservices, in this case the system have three services, three Docker Containers.
